# Sudoku
WellCode - My eighth project
#### For each new game, a new Sudoku puzzle is generated. The puzzles are randomly generated, but they all follow the same pattern (established by me). Every time a player fills in a number, the program checks if the "move" is valid: it checks the row, the column and the square and if the number already exists in any of the aforementioned, a "Not allowed! Check..." message is displayed.
#### When all the blank squares are correctly filled in, the player is informed that he solved the puzzle.
